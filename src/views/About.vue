                        <p class="section_col_text para ">Sol Christian Academy is an independent, fee paying, faith school based in Greater Manchester in Manchester. We have been offering a Christian education to children between the ages of three and eighteen since 2013. During this time we have been privileged to share the formative years of many children from different backgrounds, nationalities and cultures and, we believe, have added great value to their young lives.
                        At Sol Christian Academy we have always identified our role as being an extension of the Christian home and we have worked hard to engender a positive, encouraging, familiar atmosphere where relationships are nurtured. From our first intake of three children we have steadily grown in student numbers to forty.

                    <p class="col-md-12 section_col_text para"> Our school is now divided into four distinct learning centres, from the pre-school through to the seniors. Each learning centre operates independently, as a class would in a mainstream school. All learning centres come together for times of worship and assembly.Each of our learning centres has always catered for a wider age range than just one academic year because the children work at their own pace, albeit under close supervision.
                        At Sol Christian Academy we insist on the highest academic and moral standards. High standards of achievement through the ACE curriculum, continual love and encouragement from our dedicated staff, combined with a steady input of the Word of God and adherence to a strict code of conduct have always paid great dividends in the young lives entrusted to our care.

                    <p class="section_col_text" style="font-size: 10px">(A.C.E.) has been the trendsetter in Biblical educational reform. Its philosophy is built on basic principles of the Word of God. Students are taught to see life from God’s point of view, to take responsibility for their own learning, and to walk in Godly wisdom and character.

                        ACCELERATED CHRISTIAN EDUCATION IS A BIBLE-BASED K-12 PROGRAM. 
                    </strong>
                    <p class="section_col_text " style="font-size: 11px">
                        Accelerated Christian Education was founded in 1970 by Donald and Esther Howard in Garland, Texas. The ministry began solely upon God’s leading to meet the need for an individualized, Biblically-based education for children. Their desire was to assist parents, pastors, and school staff in the Lord’s command of Deuteronomy 6:7 ” And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk to them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up”.
                        Mr. and Mrs. Howard started the first Learning Center in their home, but in just one year had five schools joining their staff training! By 1974, more than 500 schools across the U.S. had implemented the program. A.C.E. has taken a conventionally styled textbook and divided it into bite-sized workbooks called <a href="https://www.aceministries.com/what-is-a-pace">PACEs (Packets of Accelerated Christian Education)</a>  which are full of self-instructional activities designed to develop thinking skills and create mastery learning.  
                        A.C.E. has been adding programs for students to participate in activities outside of the classroom since 1973.   <a href="https://www.acestudentprograms.com/rsc/about-rsc" target="_blank">Regional</a> and  <a href="https://www.acestudentprograms.com/isc/about-isc" target="_blank">International Student Conventions</a> help students grow closer to the Lord Jesus Christ and demonstrate their achievements in a wide range of categories from chess to Bible, basketball to art. <a href="https://www.acestudentprograms.com/sa/about-sa" target="_blank">service adventures</a>Service Adventures and <a href="https://www.acestudentprograms.com/ea/about-ea" target="_blank">Educational Assistance</a> Programs in foreign countries give students the opportunity to step outside their comfort zones, to share Christ’s love with schools in need, and to be involved in reaching children.
                        The first international school using A.C.E. curriculum opened in 1974 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. However, throughout the years, separate warehouses opened in Australia, the Philippines, Russia, United Kingdom, and Africa. Today A.C.E. serves more than 6,000 schools and countless homeschool families around the globe.
