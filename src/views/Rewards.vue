                        The role of rewards and praise in recognising and promoting the school’s values is a key component of developing the potential of our students by giving them encouragement and praise; praise is a key component of good teaching and good staff/student relationships. Good behaviour is also best promoted and developed by drawing attention to and rewarding well behaved and hardworking students. Praise is used appropriately, sincerely and will be linked to tangible examples of a student’s strengths or effort.
                        <br>
                        Students’ hard work, good behaviour and demonstration of the School’s core values are recognised and celebrated by teachers in many different ways, including:

Whilst we believe the most effective way of managing behaviour is to praise and reward good behaviour, there are occasions and circumstances when other support is required. Where students are having difficulty conforming to the expected standards of behaviour various strategies and systems may be employed to help them improve.
                        <br>
                        In the Learning Centre, some examples of strategies that teachers may deploy include:

                Discipline is firm, fair and consistent. If further punishment is required, it usually consists of a detention, referral to a senior member of staff or a warning letter. Exclusions, either internal or when students are asked to stay away from school for a set time are also used for serious offences. 
                <br>
                On rare occasions, when a member of the Senior Leadership Team is involved, parents may be invited to the School to discuss particular issues.
